    title: Registration
    content: Residents of Stevens County and the surrounding area are encouraged to
      fill out a registration card for access to the library's collection
      (Viking Library System). Proof of residency and a valid I.D. are required.
      Children may register for their own card with parent/guardian consent.
      Residents belonging to other Minnesota Library systems can register their
      'home' library card with the Viking Library System. Morris Library users
      are expected to abide by the policies set by this library board.
  - title: Library Behavior
    content: The library is used by many people for a variety of activities. It is
      hoped that the space will be used in a way which is respectful to all.
      That means no running and using a quiet voice that is not disruptive to
      others (cell phones should be used in the lobby). While we encourage
      children to have fun, the library is not a playground. Children should not
      be left alone, if they cannot manage their behavior appropriately.
  - title: Circulation and Fines

      Morris Public Library

      Internet Use and Safety Policy


      The Morris Public Library provides access to the internet as a service to fulfill our mission to provide information in a wide variety of formats to a diverse audience. Selected online resources, online databases (paid for by the library), children’s games, and word processing software are available in addition to the internet. At the same time we attempt to protect users from unwanted exposure to visually depicted obscenity and child pornography.


      In order to offer such protection and to comply with Public Law 106-554, Title XVII, the library has installed filtering software which is intended by the manufacturer to block access to possible illegal and inappropriate sites. The user should be aware, however, that no device or software can block every site which contains illegal or inappropriate content; and sites may be blocked that do not contain illegal or inappropriate content. The library does not accept responsibility for these incidents.


      Please be aware that some information found via the internet may be inaccurate, incomplete, or dated. Some sources may be offensive or disturbing, to some audiences. It is up to the user to evaluate the validity and appropriateness of information found in this setting. Parents and/or guardians are responsible for the online activities of their children/minors.


      At this time, anyone may sign-up to use the computers (you do not need to have a library card). Anyone who uses the internet computers is required to sign-up as a way of gathering statistics and tracking time. Sign-up is on a first-come, first-serve basis. Computer sessions may be limited to one hour, if people are waiting. Fifteen minutes before closing, you should finish up what you are working on (staff may give a fifteen minute notice). Five minutes before closing the internet stations will be shut down.


      In addition, to use the internet computers at the Morris Public Library you must agree to comply with the following rules before signing up:


      1. Internet computers will not be used for illegal activity, to access illegal materials, or to access materials that by local community standards would be inappropriate.


      2. Users will obey copyright laws and licensing agreements.


      3. Users will not make any attempt to gain unauthorized access to restricted library or internet files or networks, or to damage or modify computer equipment or software at the library or at another location using library connections.


      4. Users will not disclose, use, or disseminate personal information regarding minors without written authorization of the parent or legal guardian of the minor involved.


      For your convenience, a black/white printer is available from the internet workstations. Copies are $.15 / page and can be paid for at the desk.


      The library also has WiFi wireless internet access for anyone who wants to bring in and use their own laptop.


      Library staff does not monitor how the internet is used, and no attempt is made to censor or comment on what users are viewing. Remember that you are in a public space and what you view online may be viewed by others.


      Please respect the rights of others and refrain from using the cell phone. Conversations should be kept to a minimum with no more than two gathered around any one workstation.


      The library staff is committed to helping people with their information requests; please ask for assistance if you are not finding what you need, or alert staff with any computer problems you may encounter.


      I have read the above policy and I agree to its terms. I acknowledge that failure to follow these rules of conduct may result in loss on internet privileges.


          _______________________________________________

      A meeting room is available for community functions. Please check the
      calendar for availability and then call the library to reserve it.
      Commercial businesses are charged $25.00/day for use of the room.


      When reserving the room, please allow for set-up and tear-down time. The room should be left in the condition in which it was found, or better.
  - title: Friends of the Library
    content: >-
      The Friends of the Library is a group of dedicated library users who host
      a book sale in July to raise money to enrich and strengthen the collection
      and programs the library provides. In the past they have sponsored author
      events, promoted children's activities through entertainment and treats,
      and have purchased select books and shelving for the collection.


      Head phones to be used with the computers and a display case were purchased. A 'giving' (Gingko) tree was planted in the park area near the library for the community. The Friends were also responsible for updating the meeting room with computer technology. 


      The Friends typically meet in the library community room at 5:30 p.m. on the fourth Monday of the month. Anyone is welcomed to attend. Please contact the Friends or the Library to confirm time and place of the monthly meetings.


      The Friends are always looking for individuals who want to take an active role in the organization's ongoing mission to enrich the library's services and collections. Financial contributions are also appreciated. Contact Tim Lindberg, 651-717-8002 for more information on how you can become involved.
