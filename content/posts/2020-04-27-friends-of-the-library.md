The Friends of the Library is a group of dedicated library users who host a book sale in July to raise money to enrich and strengthen the collection and programs the library provides. In the past they have sponsored author events, promoted children's activities through entertainment and treats, and have purchased select books and shelving for the collection.

Head phones to be used with the computers and a display case were purchased. A 'giving' (Gingko) tree was planted in the park area near the library for the community. The Friends were also responsible for updating the meeting room with computer technology.

The Friends typically meet in the library community room at 5:30 p.m. on the fourth Monday of the month. Anyone is welcomed to attend. Please contact the Friends or the Library to confirm time and place of the monthly meetings.

The Friends are always looking for individuals who want to take an active role in the organization's ongoing mission to enrich the library's services and collections. Financial contributions are also appreciated. Contact Tim Lindberg, 651-717-8002 for more information on how you can become involved.
