The mission of the Morris Public Library is to provide reading and non-print materials as well as current technology and electronic resources for people of all ages, skills, abilities, backgrounds, and economic means.

Our vision is to serve as a community destination that promotes life-long learning, cultural enrichment, and entertainment; by connecting people and ideas through library services and programming with a welcoming atmosphere, supportive staff assistance, and individual guidance to information and resources.
